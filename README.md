# Predictive-Text-Java
Predictive text allows the user to press a key only once to reach any of the letters it represents. A dictionary is used by the system to “predict” which of the letters of the key the user actually wanted to use. The principle relies on the fact that in a language, a sequence of keystrokes only corresponds to few words.
