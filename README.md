# Predictive-Text-Java
Most mobile phones offer predictive text to make easier enter messages write for instance text with mobile phone keyboards, which usually only contain 12 keys. Several letters are then written pressing the same key.

Predictive text allows the user to press a key only once to reach any of the letters it represents. A dictionary is used by the system to “predict” which of the letters of the key the user actually wanted to use. The principle relies on the fact that in a language, a sequence of keystrokes only corresponds to few words.
